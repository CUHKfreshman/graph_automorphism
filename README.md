Before running, cd to DviCL, comment stat(), i.e., "//stat();" in main function of bliss.cc (line 1396), then cmd "make".
"chmod -R 777 ." to enable permissions.
Run python3 app.py to access the Dash application.
Note: Not compatible with Windows.
# NOTE
IM now only supports facebook1.txt with a fixed seed set & result. It is independent of SSM/AutoTree at this stage so that DViCL can be ignored if only wants to visualize IM.
# TODOs
1.  Improvement
2.  Experiment
3.  Centrality
